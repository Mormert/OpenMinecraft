This file is to help you use this Demo.
A brief description of the use of this project is here:

1. Basic information:
This Demo has been verified on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Jetson Nano;
This Demo has been verified using the e-paper Driver HAT module. 
You can view the corresponding test routines in the examples\ of the project;

2. Pin connection:
Pin connections can be viewed in \lib\waveshare_TSL2591\TSL2591.py and will be repeated here:
TSL25911    =>    Jetson Nano/RPI(BCM)
VCC         ->    3.3V
GND         ->    GND
SDA         ->    SDA
SCL         ->    SCL
INT         ->    4

3.Installation library
Raspberry Pi
    Installation BCM2835
        1.	wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.60.tar.gz
        2.	tar zxvf bcm2835-1.60.tar.gz 
        3.	cd bcm2835-1.60/
        4.	sudo ./configure
        5.	sudo make
        6.	sudo make check
        7.	sudo make install
        8.	# More can refer to the official websiteï¼šhttp://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/
    
    Installation wiringPi
        1.	sudo apt-get install wiringpi
        2.	#For Raspberry Pi 4B you may need to upgrade:
        3.	cd /tmp
        4.	wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb
        5.	sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb
        6.	gpio -v
        7.	# Running gpio -v will appear version 2.52, if there is no error, the installation is wrong.
        
Jetson Nano
    No need to install any libraries, but only supports USE_DEV_LIB
    
In the Makefile
    # USELIB = USE_BCM2835_LIB
    # USELIB = USE_WIRINGPI_LIB
    USELIB = USE_DEV_LIB
Raspberry Pi stand by BCM2835, WIRINGPI and DEV_LIB
Jetson Nano  stand by DEV_LIB

4. Basic use:
Test the program in the examples\ directory:
    make clean 
    make
    sudo ./main
